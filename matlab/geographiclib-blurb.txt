This toolbox provides native MATLAB implementations of a subset of the
C++ library, GeographicLib.  Key components of this toolbox are

  * Geodesics: direct, inverse, area calculations.
  * Projections: transverse Mercator, polar stereographic, etc.
  * Grid systems: UTM, UPS, MGRS.
  * Geoid lookup: EGM84, EGM96, EGM2008 geoids supported.
  * Geometric transformations: geocentric, local cartesian.
  * Great ellipses: direct, inverse, area calculations.

There is some overlap between this toolbox and MATLAB's Mapping
Toolbox.  However, this toolbox offers:

  * better accuracy;
  * treatment of oblate and prolate ellipsoids;
  * guaranteed convergence for geoddistance;
  * calculation of area and differential properties of geodesics;
  * ellipsoidal versions of the equidistant azimuthal and gnomonic
    projections.

Subsets of this package were previously released as:

  Geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution (deprecated)
  Geodesic projections for an ellipsoid (withdrawn)
  Great ellipses (withdrawn)

Including all of the functionality in a single toolbox allows easier
sharing of code (via a common private directory).

Extensive documentation on the C++ library is available at

  http://geographiclib.sf.net/html

Geoid lookup requires the installation of one or more geoid models.
Instructions for this are given in

  http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/geoid.html#geoidinst

A problem with the way MATLAB Central packages toolboxes causes the
"Robust Control Toolbox" to be listed as a required product. This is
wrong; this package has no dependencies other than MATLAB (version 7.9
or later) or Octave (version 3.4 or later).

Changes in 1.44:

   - Changes to improve accuracy when evaluating trigonometric
     functions.
   - There is now no restriction on longitudes and azimuths; any
     values can be used.
   - NaNs are returned if latitudes outside the range [-90,90] are
     specified.
   - geoddistance sets s12 to zero for coincident points at pole
     (instead of returning a tiny quantity).
   - As a consequence, cassini_fwd now returns the correct azimuth for
     points at the pole.
   - Routines now return array results with the right shape.
   - Routines now properly handle mixed scalar and array arguments.
   - mgrs_fwd now treats treats prec > 11 as prec = 11.
   - mgrs_fwd ensures that digits in lower precision results match
     those at higher precision.
   - Illegal letter combinations are now correctly detected by
     mgrs_inv.
   - Fixed bug where mgrs_inv returned the wrong results for prec = 0
     strings and center = 0.
   - mgrs_inv now decodes prec = 11 strings properly.
   - More accurate rounding in mgrs_inv;  this change only makes a
     difference at sub-meter precisions.
